## Overview
Projects completed during Bachelor of Computer Science at Monash University focused on finding optimal solutions using various strategies and algorithms including Dijkstra's algorithm, dynamic programming, and A* (Ukennon). Additionally, smaller projects such as the Space Invader Game and mobile design prototypes were also undertaken.

## Challenges
During my Bachelor’s degree, I worked on multiple projects requiring diverse skills. Most of these projects were implemented in environments like the console or terminal. However, a lack of proper folder structure and organization meant that some projects are now inaccessible or cannot be reopened.

This experience taught me the critical importance of organizing and structuring projects effectively. As a result, I have adopted better practices in my Master’s degree, ensuring all projects are saved and organized systematically to prevent similar issues in the future.
